## Requirements

```
GPU=NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core
beautifulsoup4==4.9.3
FastNLP==1.0.1
fitlog==0.9.15
nltk==3.8.1
numpy==1.24.4
pandas==1.1.3
sparse==0.14.0
torch==1.13.1+cu117
torch_scatter==2.0.9

```

## Preprocess your datasets
Put ACE datasets in the `preprocess/data` directory, following a similar structure as demonstrated in [CNN_Nested_NER](https://github.com/yhcc/CNN_Nested_NER) 

For GENIA dataset, we use the version from [W2NER](https://github.com/ljynlp/W2NER)

## Train

   ```
   bash train_arg_{dataset}.sh
   ```
The item {dataset} can be replaced with "04", "05" or "genia". The experiment results can be found in the directory `logs` after initiating the training process.

## Evaluate with Checkpoint File

```
   bash eval_arg_{dataset}.sh
```
